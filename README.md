These projects are based on the IoT botnet detection using Generative Adeversarial Netowrk (GAN).
These codes include experimental setup for finding the best running model with the hyperparamaters setting.
The second code is for testing the perofomance of the GAN model using the Ba-IoT, UNSW-NB15 and Bot-IoT Data sets.
The framework can be used with every real dataset that has numerical value for the task of binary classification.
The framework also include the usage of dimensionality reduction in training SVM.
