These projects are based on the IoT botnet detection using Generative Adeversarial Netowrk (GAN).
The first code is for finding the best running model with the hyperparamaters setting.
The second code is for testing the perofomance of the GAN model using the N-BAIoT-Danmini Datasest.
The framework can be used with every real dataset that has numerical value with the task of binary classification.
